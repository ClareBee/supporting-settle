<blockquote>
"We’re limiting the number of customers allowed in the shop at any one time. Although this may result in some queuing outside, it’s worth the short wait to keep you safe. We're also asking that only one family member visits us.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
At the entrances to the shop, we’ve installed hand sanitising stations which are regularly checked and refilled when necessary. Practicing good hand hygiene is absolutely essential, especially at this moment in time.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
We’ve gone a little crazy on the tape! We’ve clearly marked out the safe queuing distance at tills so you know where you stand (literally) and this also applies for our aisles which have clear distance markers.
Protective screens have been installed to our tills to keep both customers and team members safe. We’re also only opening three tills to help with social distancing."

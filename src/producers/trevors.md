Local deliveries. Order by text message or by direct message on Facebook. Payment by cash or card.

From the Facebook page:

<blockquote>Delivery runs will be made in the afternoon, when possible, on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday & Friday (the shop will be closed to allow for these deliveries but will be open in the morning).

I do ask two things: that someone will be around to receive the goods and that Iâ€™m not driving out to Airton to drop off a packet of ginger nuts!
